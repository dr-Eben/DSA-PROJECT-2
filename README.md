# DSA-PROJECT-2
A continuation of my first project work 

## PALMORA GROUP HR ANALYSIS 

My data set was cleaned and gender columns were fixed with (others)

ANS 1: The gender distribution

![gender distri in the org](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e45a4773-c8a3-4afb-99d7-70796c9f1763)

Males, females and others were the (3) gender distributions represented, but males slightly dominate.

### BY REGION

![gender distri by region](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b9aab56-e4bf-488d-ad70-0d9fdb38fa33)

Lagos and Kaduna have more balanced gender distributions.

Abuja shows a gender imbalance, likely favoring one gender.

### BY DEPARTMENT

![gender distri by dept](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2aac8360-298a-4f86-8270-3fbd002d5267)

Engineering and Sales are heavily male-dominated.

Support and Legal are more balanced or lean toward female representation.

 ANS 2: Ratings by Gender to assess potential performance perception biases or rating distribution inequalities. 

![perf rating by gender](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a759283-d965-49a8-9c6f-a42b2480a180)

The rating performances shows that "Good" and "Very Good" ratings are dominant across all gender categories, but:

Males have a notably higher count in the "Very Good" category.

Females show a slightly more even distribution, with visible counts in "Poor" and "Average".

Other gender employees also show strong "Very Good" ratings.
Which led me to conclude that there might be potential bias or departmental skew in how performance is rated.

ANS 3: Salary Structure and Gender Pay Gap Analysis – including regional and departmental breakdowns. 

IF THERE'S A GENDER PAY GAP:
1. Overall Salary by Gender

![av sal by gender ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea1a524b-d474-4742-980d-9e6ef05a8c44)

Males earn the highest average salary.

Females earn noticeably less on average.

Employees with  Other gender fall in between, suggesting role/level or department influences.

2. By Department

![av sal by gender and department](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1227e5bc-7d6c-4af3-b41d-07bb40e9a2cb)

The Sales, Engineering, and Legal departments show significant pay gaps, favoring males. Therefore these departments should be concentrated on.

In departments like Support and possibly HR, the gap is narrower or reversed.

3. By Region

![av sal by gender and region](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1442529a-2913-46de-9268-ede3fbef61c1)

Kaduna region shows the highest gap.

Across all regions, males earn more on average.

Abuja has a smaller gap.

ANS 4: Check if Palmoria complies with the $90,000 minimum salary rule and visualize salary bands overall and by region. 

After analyzing the data we can say that Palmoria does not comply with the new regulation that mandates a minimum salary of $90,000 for employees.

Salary Band Distribution Insights Overall:

![Sal distri em overoll](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4a4ad3f-97da-4489-8608-4fbd88f1cb05)

A large portion of employees fall within the $50,000 – $90,000 range.

The number of employees drastically drops after the $90K mark, showing a skew toward lower salary bands.

By Region:

![Sal distri by region](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba89ab4b-f46c-4143-a18d-a491e4ba8bc0)

Kaduna and Lagos have higher concentrations in lower bands.

Abuja has a slightly better spread into higher bands, though not by much.

Implement a strategy to bring salaries above the $90,000 threshold, especially in Kaduna and Lagos.

ANS 5: Anount to be paid in bonus to individual employee and salary inclusive of bonus
